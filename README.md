USD Coin Core Integration Repository
=====================================

USD Coin (USD) is 100% decentralized P2P cryptocurrency that delivers ease of use along with a fast, secure and anonymous network hosted on Masternodes globally. As a result of its decentralization, no central organization or entity controls USD Coin. The core dev team of USD are simply members of the USD Community who believe professionalism, integrity and quality are the 3 pillars of a strong cryptocurrency. USD differentiates itself from other cryptocurrencies by providing a fast, secure and stable platform to grow mass adoption globally. USD is able to ensure that coin holders may store, send and receive coins anonymously and securely through the use of both desktop and mobile wallets.

USD Coin has been built as a modified fork of PIVX and has kept sustainability top-of-mind with USD being a 100% Proof of Stake Masternode currency. At just 60 seconds, block times are 10x faster than parent coin Bitcoin, without having the negative environmental impact of high energy POW mining.

USD Coin is a modified fork of the Masternode currency PIVX. PIVX was chosen as the parent codebase as a result of its proven foundations, algorithm and block reward distribution system. USD Coin separates itself through longevity supporting coin specifications, customized QT wallets, explicit Masternode and POS wallet block rewards and an intentionally low maximum coin supply of 25,000,000 USD Coins. Block Rewards halve every 1,000,000 blocks per 1,388 days until the maximum total supply of 25 million USD Coins is reached in 100+ years.

All core code for USD Coin is completely open source and is available on Github in a dedicated repository under the MIT License: https://github.com/Unitedstatedollarcrypto/zenith-repository. Community members may use the available code to create use cases of their own, and have full permission to do so whether these uses be for private or commercial use.
